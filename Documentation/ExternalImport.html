    <h2>
        External Import
    </h2>
    Import data from an external file.
    <p>
    <li>
        <label>Import from file</label> The file to import.
        Click Browse, then select the file to
        import.  Ensure that the file type matches the type expected by the
        import mapping specified below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Import mapping</label> What import mapping to use.  Ensure that
        the file type expected by the import mapping matches the type of the
        file selected above.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Existing records</label> Controls what happens when the imported
        data includes records that are already present in the system:
        <ul>
            <table border=1>
                <tr>
                    <td>Keep existing record</td>
                    <td>
                        The existing record in the registration system is
                        kept.  The record from the import file is ignored.
                        (Requires that the import mapping specify a unique
                        identifier field.)
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Replace existing record</td>
                    <td>
                        The record from the import file is used; the existing
                        record in the registration system is discarded.
                        (Synchronization data is retained so the newly imported
                        record will propagate to other servers.)
                        (Requires that the import mapping specify a unique
                        identifier field.)
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Update existing record</td>
                    <td>
                        Records from the import file that do not exist in the
                        registration system are ignored.  Existing records are
                        updated, field by field, with the fields present in the
                        import file.
                        (Requires that the import mapping specify a unique
                        identifier field.)
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Zap all existing records</td>
                    <td>
                        DISCARDS all records currently existing in the
                        registration system; imports new records from the
                        import file.  CAUTION!
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Add duplicate</td>
                    <td>
                        Adds all records from the import file.  If they already
                        exist in the registration system, this will add
                        duplicate records.  You almost never want this option.
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
