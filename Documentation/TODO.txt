What should happen when a station moves from one server to another?  Depends on whether the server has the same name.  If it does, it's the same station.  If not, it's a different station.


AQ list has funky rendering in Firefox.  Probably related to dynamically changing list.

Try with 6+ label printers

working(true) is currently triggered by individual operations.  Perhaps all Nav operations should trigger it.  But note that that would mean PageUp/PageDn would need working(false).  But maybe only Nav, PgUp/PgDn, and Base.switchTo.  Oh, and anything that returns to the same page, e.g. aborted printing.  Perhaps working(true) should have some visible indication, though the general theory is that if it ever takes more than a small fraction of a second it's too long.

Widgets don't get full focus marking until you use keyboard navigation.  Or something like that.

Keyboard commands are still kind of iffy.  See comments in Base.

Log:
	parentelem is not implemented
	If Log() is instantiated before <body> loads, we end up with two bodies.
    Maybe look again at my log infrastructure

Maybe have "All" support be a generic feature for List?  It's now a generic feature for DBManager, but maybe it should move down into List.  (But maybe it should really be checkbox-based to allow for different filters - e.g. for printers there's "show printers on all servers" and "show hidden printers".)

Push the printer support work upstream.

Consider using Element.classList instead of Element.className when adding and removing entries.

NewConventionWad (and others?) save Mercurial and GIT history, and shouldn't.
NewConventionWad shouldn't save SampleData (and others?)
NewServerWad - maybe CloneThisConventionWad or something like that?

Need an "update the program" wad.  For this convention, or for a selected convention, or generic and you pick on the target?

NewConventionOnThisSystem needs error checking on the mkdir.

All of the setup stuff could probably use more checking on the new directory name.

Home should set page title to pick up convention name changes.

Blue Sky

Support multiple conventions.

Maybe TLS and certificate authentication for clients?  But then you have to import the server cert on the clients, and you have to somehow get a client cert to the clients.

Make the server ID be configurable, so that you can preconfigure servers and then (re)assign them to existing IDs.  Probably this would take the form of demanding a server ID if one has not been assigned.  (probably not)

Badges
	* Schedule for program participants
	** Requires coordination with Programming for what key to use
	   for the member.

New merged database is a PITA to edit.  Need general-purpose DBMS tools.

Drive member schema largely or completely from a table.

Credit card integration

Receipts.  Note that receipt might need to cover multiple memberships and perhaps upgrades.
