    <h2>
        Add/Edit External Import Mapping
    </h2>
    Add or edit an external import mapping.
    <p>
    The idea is that you define an import mapping that describes how to import
    a particular external format, and then you can use that import mapping
    numerous times to import data from those files.
    <p>
    DBF note:  deleted records are not imported.  Ref issue
    <a href="https://github.com/jordanbrown0/reg3/issues/179">#179</a/>.
    <p>
    Import mapping requires knowing the names and semantics of the fields in
    the various tables.  See <a href="Schema.html">the schema documentation</a>
    and, for "members", <a href="ReportSchema.html">the schema report</a>.
    <p>
    There are three pages:
    <li>General information about the import.</li>
    <li>How to map fields.</li>
    <li>How to map classes.</li>
    <p>
    When adding a new import mapping, you are initially asked only for the
    description and the destination table.  After that, the destination table
    cannot be changed.
    <p>
    <h3>Page 1: General information</h3>
    <li>
        <label>Description</label> description of the import mapping.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Destination table</label> what table to import to.  This entry
        cannot be changed after the import mapping is initially created.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>File type</label> what general data format to import from.
        The types are DBF (dBASE), CSV with headers, and CSV without headers.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Encoding</label> character encoding for the external data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Unique identifier field</label> name of an external-record
        field that contains a unique identifier managed by the external system.
        If specified, this mechanism allows for re-importing data from the
        external source, replacing or updating previously imported records.
    </li>
    <h3>Page 2: Field mappings</h3>
    This page has a list that says how external fields are copied to fields
    in this system's tables.  It is not necessary that every external field
    be imported; external fields that are not mentioned in the import map are
    ignored.  It is not necessary that every field in the import map be present
    in the external data; missing fields are ignored.
    <p>
    Use the <button>+</button> and <button>-</button> buttons to add or remove
    entries.
    <p>
    For each entry:
    <li>
        <label>External name</label> the name used in the external data.
        Note: for CSV without headers, this is the column number, starting
        with 1.
    </li>
    <li><label>Field name</label> the name of the field to import into.</li>
    <li>
        <label>Converter</label> the name of a conversion function that should
        process the data for the field; see table below.
    </li>
    <h3>Page 3: Class mappings</h3>
    This page has a list that says how membership classes should be mapped
    during the import.  It is not necessary that every external class name
    be represented; class names that are not mentioned here are imported
    unchanged.  It is not necessary that every class listed here be represented
    in the external data; unused entries are ... unused.
    <p>
    Use the <button>+</button> and <button>-</button> buttons to add or remove
    entries.
    <p>
    For each entry:
    <li>
        <label>External name</label> name of the class as known in the external
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <label>Class name</label> name of the class as defined in the
        <a href="ClassManager.html">class list</a>.
    </li>
