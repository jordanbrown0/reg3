Development Conventions

* Batch files are runnable from any directory.  If they create files, the files are created in the directory they are run from.
* No business logic in the server.
* No modifying param structures in the callee.
* "Tally" reports are done by pushing a reduce expression to the server to execute, with the assumption that the data returned will be manageable in size.
* Member records contain class code, not class key, so that you can delete and recreate a class without breaking the linkage.
* Don't trust client time.  Don't trust server time zone.  Do trust server UTC (or server local time?).

Design note:  if you're on server A, and you merge {A:1} with {B:1}, the result has to be {A:2, B:1} so that the changes involved in the merge itself cause a version bump.  Otherwise, if it resulted in {A:1, B:1} then it would be indistinguishable from a record resulting from a potentially different merge on another server.
