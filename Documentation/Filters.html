        Filters
    </h2>
    The filter user interface appears in a number of places to allow you to
    select records based on arbitrary criteria.
    <p>
    It defaults to matching all records.  You can pick operators off of a
    pull-down list to add criteria.  All operators other than "All" require
    one or more parameters, each of which can be another expression.
    <p>
    The record matches if the result is "truthy" - non-empty, non-zero, true -
    and does not match if the result is "falsey".

                True if none of its arguments are falsey.
                <br>
                Technical note: starts with true, evaluates arguments until
                it reaches a falsey value or the end, and returns the last
                value processed.

                True if any of its arguments are truthy.

                Technical note: starts with false, evaluates arguments until
                it reaches a truthy value or the end, and returns the last
                value processed.

                True if its argument is falsey, and false if it its argument
                is truthy.

                If its first argument is truthy, returns its second argument.
                If the first argument is falsey, returns its third argument.
                <br>
                Technical note: either the second or third argument is
                evaluated, not both.

                Returns true if its arguments are the same, and false if not.
                <br>
                Technical note: although it is not an error to compare unlike
                types - text and a number, say - the comparison rules are
                tricky and it is best to compare only like types.

        <tr>

            <td>One, constant</td>
            <td>
                Splits the argument into individual words.  Scans all of the
                fields in the record; returns true if all of the words are
                found in the record.  This is the same matching mechanism used
                for "Previously registered" lookups.

            <td>
                Arguments are names of defined member classes.  Returns true
                if the member class is any of the classes listed.

                Arguments are names of defined member categories.  Returns true
                if the member is in any of the categories listed.
                <br>
                Note:  use "All of" combined with multiple "Category any of"
                operators to match records that are in all of the categories
                listed.
