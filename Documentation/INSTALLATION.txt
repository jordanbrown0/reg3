INSTALLATION

CLIENT

There is almost no client installation required.  The client needs to have the latest version of Internet Explorer (or pretty much any other modern web browser).  On the to-do list is providing a desktop icon and a startup link that start a web browser pointed at the server.

The client has to join the appropriate network, typically via WiFi.

SERVER

Q:  Shared Node.js?
A:  Yes, in a per-version directory.  That way a particular Reg3 instance can use its favorite Node.js version.

Q:  Shared Reg3?
A:  No.  Reg3 itself is quite small, and so having a copy for each convention is not a significant burden.  That way you always have a copy of Reg3 that matches the convention's data.

Q:  Node.js installation directory path?
A:  Documents\Reg3\node-vXX.YY.Z-win-x86

Q:  Per-convention directory path?
A:  Documents\Reg3\$CON


DEVELOPER

The reference copy is on github at

For JavaScript development, you can extract that on top of a convention directory and work.  However, that won't let you make changes to the C++ printing module, and you can't start with *just* the sources and produce a working environment.  You need the prerequisites for full Node.js installations, which include Python and Microsoft Visual C++.  I don't remember the details and will need to rediscover them.
