        Installation
    </h2>

    <h3>Client</h3>
    <p>
        There is almost no client installation required.  The client needs to
        have the latest version of Internet Explorer (or pretty much any other
        modern web browser).
    </p>
    <p>
        The client has to join the appropriate network, typically via WiFi.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="Admin.html">administration menu</a> offers a small
        installer that will create desktop shortcuts.
    </p>

    <h3>Server</h3>
    <p>
        Reg3 is distributed as a single .EXE file named
        Reg3-&lt;release&gt;.exe.  To install:
    </p>
    <li>Execute that file.</li>
    <li>A small popup window will ask for confirmation.</li>
    <li>A command-prompt window will ask for the name of a directory name
        to use for the convention.
    </li>
    <li>If that directory does not yet exist, you'll be asked whether you
        want to set it up.
        If it does exist, you'll be asked whether you want to upgrade the
        existing installation.
    </li>
    <p>
        A fresh installation is quite boring. Before it will be useful, you
        must:
    </p>
    <li>Set convention-global configuration values - convention name,
        start date, et cetera.
    </li>
    <li>Install label printer drivers on servers.</li>
    <li>Mark label printers as being label printers.</li>
    <li>Allocate membership numbers for each server to assign.</li>
    <li>Set up membership classes.</li>
    <li>Set up stations, assigning a label printer to each.</li>
    <p>
        Probably:
    </p>
    <li>Set up an import map to import data from pre-convention sources.
    </li>
    <li>Import pre-convention data.</li>
    <p>
        Optionally:
    </p>
    <li>Set up "standard" upgrades.</li>
    <li>Set up metaclasses, assign classes to metaclasses, and authorize
        appropriate stations to issue memberships from those metaclasses.
    </li>
    <li>Set permissions appropriately for particular stations.</li>
    <li>Add custom fields.</li>
    <li>Assign names to servers, stations, and label printers.</li>
    <li>Set up member categories.</li>
    <li>Set up automatic corrections.</li>
    <li>Set up export maps.</li>
    <li>Renumber memberships if pre-convention data does not include
        membership numbers.
    </li>
    <p>
        You might be able to use <u>A</u>dministration
        <u>S</u>ynchronize <u>E</u>xport <u>S</u>elected and <u>I</u>mport
        to copy settings from another convention.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions each get their own directory, in
        Documents\Reg3\$CON.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions share Node.js installations, in per-version directories.
        That way a particular Reg3 instance can use its favorite Node.js
        version. Node.js is installed in Documents\Reg3\node-vXX.YY.Z-win-x86.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions do <b>not</b> share Reg3 itself.  This keeps the convention
        data with a matched copy of the program.

    <p>
        For JavaScript development, you can extract that on top of a convention
        directory and work.  However, that won't let you make changes to the
        C++ printing module, and you can't start with *just* the sources and
        produce a working environment.  You need the prerequisites for full
        Node.js installations, which include Python and Microsoft Visual C++.
        I don't remember the details and will need to rediscover them.
