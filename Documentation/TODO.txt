Need error messages for "your station is configured to print on a printer on a different server".  Whether that will be a real issue will depend on network configuration; if the server is always the same name / IP address then stations will maintain their identity when moved.

What should happen when a station moves from one server to another?  Depends on whether the server has the same name.  If it does, it's the same station.  If not, it's a different station.

For stations and printers, default to showing only those for this server.

AQ list has funky rendering in Firefox.  Probably related to dynamically changing list.

Browser-side errors need to interrupt UI
window.addEventListener('error', function(event) { ... })
window.onerror = function(message, source, lineno, colno, error) { ... }

Make it clearer when an error is a server-side error.

Try with 6+ label printers

What is UI for new members?
	* how does lookup in MASTER fit in?
	* Do anything about looking up existing memberships first?

Import from DBF
    Import from DBF is basically working, with schema translation.
    Can't import directly into a new DB because the server doesn't return "members" in a table list. How to prime?  Maybe client-side init does a no-op DB operation to get the table set up.  Or maybe the selection is based on the client-side list of tables rather than the server-side list.
    Deliver a canned Reg v2 import somehow?  Maybe by delivering a *.json that
    you can import that will bring in an externalImport map?
    Should be able to import from browser upload, rather than from server file.
    Should fields be ignored by default, or lower-cased and imported by default?
    If they are ignored by default, it's a nuisance to have to fill out the import form.
    If they are imported by default, there's no obvious way to *omit* unwanted fields.
    Not that unwanted fields cause any real trouble.  Member Solutions unwanted fields have very verbose names; it would be unfortunate to duplicate them.
    Convert date formats on import.
    File open errors are not reported back to the user.

Import from Member Solutions
    Partial.  Need content cleanup (e.g. "$75.00" => 75, class name, one-line badge name to two-line badge name).
Import from Eventbrite
Import from CSV
    Column oriented, or with headers?  Probably both.
    Header variant sort of works.
    Get numbers to be numbers.
Import from .XLSX?

Maybe need a "zap table" user interface.  Or maybe external import has a "clear first" option.

Does JS - and in particular node.js - intern strings?  If not, we might want to make a point of interning them at DB load time and record update/add time - at least the field names.

Various imports should probably assign membership numbers if they aren't assigned.  Ugh.  That would mean involving the UI, since the server doesn't know about membership numbers.  Or maybe there's a bulk "assign membership numbers to all records without them".

How should an import file be fed into the system?  Options are upload and direct file access. Direct file access is awkward.  Upload has a problem with how to specify the desired import mapping.  Multipart might allow RPC+file upload.  Or one URL component could be the record ID for the mapping record.

Export (DBF?  CSV?)
Export only marked records?  Perhaps by category?

Developer wads

Bulk ops
	Delete
	Modify?
	report

bulk edit - e.g. for all Saturday, set note

Can add/put eval operations replace the special increment method, to let add-member be a single-atomic-ish operation?  But:  an increment or put operator needs to be async, because the DB might not yet be loaded.  (In theory.)

General alert/error UI (alert()?  Modal?)

What logging do we have for REST operations?

working(true) is currently triggered by individual operations.  Perhaps all Nav operations should trigger it.  But note that that would mean PageUp/PageDn would need working(false).  But maybe only Nav, PgUp/PgDn, and Base.switchTo.  Oh, and anything that returns to the same page, e.g. aborted printing.  Perhaps working(true) should have some visible indication, though the general theory is that if it ever takes more than a small fraction of a second it's too long.

Widgets don't get full focus marking until you use keyboard navigation.  Or something like that.

Keyboard commands are still kind of iffy.  See comments in Base.

Log:
	parentelem is not implemented
	If Log() is instantiated before <body> loads, we end up with two bodies.
    Maybe look again at my log infrastructure

Maybe have "All" support be a generic feature for List?  It's now a generic feature for DBManager, but maybe it should move down into List.  (But maybe it should really be checkbox-based to allow for different filters - e.g. for printers there's "show printers on all servers" and "show hidden printers".)

Push the printer support work upstream.

REST operations don't have a way to return errors.  (REST upload could.  Rest download would be hard.)

Consider using Element.classList instead of Element.className when adding and removing entries.

NewConventionWad (and others?) save Mercurial and GIT history, and shouldn't.
NewConventionWad shouldn't save SampleData (and others?)
NewServerWad - maybe CloneThisConventionWad or something like that?

Need an "update the program" wad.  For this convention, or for a selected convention, or generic and you pick on the target?

NewConventionOnThisSystem needs error checking on the mkdir.

All of the setup stuff could probably use more checking on the new directory name.

Home should set page title.

Support multiple conventions.

Maybe TLS and certificate authentication for clients?  But then you have to import the server cert on the clients, and you have to somehow get a client cert to the clients.

Make the server ID be configurable, so that you can preconfigure servers and then (re)assign them to existing IDs.  Probably this would take the form of demanding a server ID if one has not been assigned.  (probably not)

Badges
	* Schedule for program participants
	** Requires coordination with Programming for what key to use
	   for the member.

New merged database is a PITA to edit.  Need general-purpose DBMS tools.

Drive member schema largely or completely from a table.

Credit card integration

Receipts.  Note that receipt might need to cover multiple memberships and perhaps upgrades.
