        Installation
    </h2>
    <h3>Client</h3>
    <p>
        There is almost no client installation required.  The client needs to
        have the latest version of Internet Explorer (or pretty much any other
        modern web browser).
    </p>
    <p>
        The client has to join the appropriate network, typically via WiFi.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <a href="Admin.html">administration menu</a> offers a small
        installer that will create desktop shortcuts.
    </p>
    <h3>Server</h3>
    NEEDSWORK this needs more about HOW you install the software, and perhaps
    about how to make installation wads.
    <p>
        Conventions each get their own directory, in
        Documents\Reg3\$CON.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions share Node.js installations, in per-version directories.
        That way a particular Reg3 instance can use its favorite Node.js
        version. Node.js is installed in Documents\Reg3\node-vXX.YY.Z-win-x86.
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions do <b>not</b> share Reg3 itself.  This keeps the convention
        data with a matched copy of the program.

For JavaScript development, you can extract that on top of a convention directory and work.  However, that won't let you make changes to the C++ printing module, and you can't start with *just* the sources and produce a working environment.  You need the prerequisites for full Node.js installations, which include Python and Microsoft Visual C++.  I don't remember the details and will need to rediscover them.
