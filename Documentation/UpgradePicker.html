        Pick a "standard" upgrade
    </h2>
    If there are any "standard" upgrades (as defined at
    <a href="UpgradesManager.html">Admin > Member > Upgrades</a>) for the
    member's current membership class, they will be listed here and you can
    pick one.  Once you pick an upgrade, you will return to the
    <a href="MemberDisplay.html">member display page</a>.
    <p>
    If the class change that you need is not listed, you can use
    <button>Other</button> to change the member to any class.
