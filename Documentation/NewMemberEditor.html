    Enter member information as required.  When you are done,
    <button>Add (<u>Enter</u>)</button> to continue to the
    <a href=MemberDisplay.html>member display page</a>.
    <p>
    You can copy the address from the last member viewed using <button>Same address (<u>ControlS</u>)</button>.
    <p>
    <b>Note:</b>  <button>Add (<u>Enter</u>)</button> adds the membership.  After that
    point you can bail out without printing a badge, but to get rid of the
    membership you must void it.  (Ref issue <a href=https://github.com/jordanbrown0/reg3/issues/261>#261</a>.)
